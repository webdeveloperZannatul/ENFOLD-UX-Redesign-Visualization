# ENFOLD-UX-Redesign-Visualization
I designed a modern UX  and visualization of the ENFOLD platform, focusing on clean structure, dynamic interactions, and a user-friendly experience. The site will feature intuitive navigation, responsive mobile-first layouts, engaging visuals, and WordPress-powered flexibility for easy updates. SEO-friendly and visually compelling.
